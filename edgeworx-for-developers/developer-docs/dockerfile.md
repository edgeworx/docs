# Example Dockerfile for building a Darcy AI application

In order to run your Darcy AI application on your Darcy cam, you will need to package your code in a Docker container. To package your code, you will run some Docker commands from the command prompt on your Darcy cam. Those commands require a text file called a "Dockerfile" which tells the Docker software how to do the packaging and build your container. A sample Dockerfile is shown below. The discussion that follows will walk you through each of the lines in the Dockerfile and explain the operations so you can make your own.

```
FROM edgeworx/darcy-ai-sdk-base:1.0.0

RUN python3 -m pip install darcyai

COPY custom_ai_model.tflite /src/
COPY custom_ai_labels.txt /src/
COPY static/ /src/static/
COPY my_application.py /src/

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "cd /src/ && python3 ./my_application.py"]
```
